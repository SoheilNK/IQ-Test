        <p>The Wechsler IQ test is a test that helps to measure cognitive abilities and intelligence. It has evolved over time, but
        the original Wechsler Intelligence Scales were developed by Dr. David Wechsler in 1939. It was initially called the
        Wechsler Bellevue Intelligence Scale, but it was revised 15 years later and renamed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
        Scale (WAIS).
        
        Wechsler is a Romanian-American psychologist who was born on Jan 12, 1896, in Romania. His family relocated to the
        states in New York when he was just a boy. He earned a Master’s Degree from Columbia University in 1917. By 1925, his
        further delve into education earned him a Ph.D. It was Robert S. Woodworth that first took a chance on the young
        psychologist. Woodworth was a big shot in the United States Army, and he was overwhelmed by the number of soldiers that
        were experiencing mental issues after the war. Working alongside Charles Spearman and Karl Pearson, Wechsler was to
        develop testing to help the army screen new draftees. However, things took a very different turn.
        
        and his initial test was the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale. The tests were developed after Dr. Wechsler’s
        realization that existing intelligence tests for adults were merely adaptations of testing used for children, and had
        little validity for adults.
        
        Over time the test evolved into three separate versions used for different age groups. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence
        Scale (WAIS) is used for adults, while the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is used for children between
        the ages of 6 and 16. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) is used for children between the
        ages of 4 and 6.5. In some cases of intellectual disabilities, the WISC may be used to help clinicians understand the
        individual’s lowest level of knowledge.
