Hi everybody.   

This is my first project as a student with Get Coding. In this project I tried to simulate two sections of Wechsler's IQ test for adults using JavaScript/Html/CSS.   

In the first section you will encounter mathematical questions and you need to answer them in a certain amount of time.  

For the second section, app will show you some pictures and you need to use the provided shapes and drag and drop them on the specific area to recreate the pattern.
In the original test the user should use special cubes to create the patterns, but it was a little bit more than I could do in my first project so I went with the 2D version. Maybe I upgrade it in next versions ðŸ™‚.   

And finally you will receive your points for each section and a description for that on a standard scale. 

Here you can find the link to the live version.

Please give it a try and I'll be happy to hear about your comments.
