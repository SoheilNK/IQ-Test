# Module1 / IQ Test

Hi everybody. 

Here you can find the link to the live version.   https://soheilnk.github.io/Module1/   

This is my first project as a student with Get Coding. In this project I tried to simulate two sections of Wechsler's IQ test for adults using JavaScript/Html/CSS.   

In the first section you will encounter mathematical questions. You need to answer them in the allotted time.  

For the second section, the app will show you some patterns. You need to recreate each pattern by dragging and dropping the provided shapes onto the given grid.
In the original test the user should use special cubes to create the patterns, but it was a little bit more than I could do in my first project so I went with the 2D version of it. Maybe I upgrade it in next versions ðŸ™‚.   

And finally you will receive your points for each section and a description for that on a standard scale. 

Please give it a try and I'll be happy to hear about your comments.
